# DataScienceProjects
This GitHub repository has been created for the purpose of showcasing a comprehensive collection of Data Science projects that I have independently developed, as well as those to which I have actively contributed.

Following is the list of projects in this repository.
1. Data Science basic practice.
2. Deep Learning Practice Projects.
3. Machine Learning Practice Projects.
  
4. Real Estate Price Prediction for Indian MegaCities.
I initiated the analysis by utilizing a correlation matrix to identify the most influential features within the dataset. Subsequently, I extensively applied various Machine Learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Through a comparative study, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest accuracy among the considered models.
