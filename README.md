# DataScienceProjects
This GitHub repository has been created for the purpose of showcasing a comprehensive collection of Data Science projects that I have independently developed, as well as those to which I have actively contributed.

Following is the list of projects in this repository.
1. Data Science basic practice.
2. Deep Learning Practice Projects.
3. Machine Learning Practice Projects.
  
4. Real Estate Price Prediction for Indian MegaCities.
I initiated the analysis by utilizing a correlation matrix to identify the most influential features within the dataset. Subsequently, I extensively applied various Machine Learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). Through a comparative study, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest accuracy among the considered models.

5. Detection of Types of Leukemia using Ensemble Learning.
Leukemia, a group of blood cancers characterized by abnormal white blood cell production, requires timely and accurate detection of the specific types of leukemia for effective treatment. However, current diagnostic methods are subjective and prone to errors. To address this, a new approach utilizing pre-trained CNN models and ensemble learning has been proposed. By combining multiple models, this method aims to enhance accuracy and efficiency in classifying leukemia types. By leveraging the power of collective intelligence, this novel methodology can provide a reliable and robust system for improved leukemia classification.
